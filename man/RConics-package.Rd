\note{
    Some of the functions are based on the \emph{projective} geometry. 
    In projective geometry parallel lines meet at an infinite point and all infinite points are incident to a line at infinity. Points and lines of a projective plane are represented by \emph{homogeneous} coordinates, that means by 3D vectors: \eqn{(x, y, z)} for the points and \eqn{(a, b, c)} such that \eqn{ax + by + c = 0} for the lines. The Euclidian points correspond to \eqn{(x, y, 1)}, the infinite points to \eqn{(x, y, 0)}, the Euclidian lines to \eqn{(a, b, c)} with \eqn{a \neq 0} or \eqn{b \neq 0}, the line at infinity to \eqn{(0, 0, 1)}.
    
    \strong{Advice}: to plot conics use the package \code{conics} from Bernard Desgraupes.
