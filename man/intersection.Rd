\title{
Intersections with conics
}
\description{
Point(s) of intersection between a conic and a line, and between two conics in homogeneous coordinates.
}
\usage{
intersectConicLine(C, l)
intersectConicConic(C1,C2)

}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{C, C1, C2}{
    \eqn{(3 \times 3)} matrix representation of conics.
  }
  \item{l}{
    a \eqn{(3 \times 3)} vector of the homogeneous representation of a line.
  }
}
%\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
%}
\value{
  The homogeneous coordinates of the intersection points. If there are two points of intersection, it returns a \eqn{(3 \times 2)} matrix whose columns correspond to the homogeneous coordinates of the intersection points. If there is only one point, a \eqn{(3 \times 1)} vector of the homogeneous coordinates of the intersection point is returned. If there is no intersection, \code{NULL} is returned.
