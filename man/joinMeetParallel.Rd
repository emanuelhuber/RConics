\title{
The join and meet of two points and the parallel
}
\description{
The join operation of two points is the cross-product of these two points and represents the line passing through them. The meet operation of two lines is the cross-product of these two lines and represents their intersection. The line parallel to a line \eqn{l} and passing through the point \eqn{p} corresponds to the join of \eqn{p} with the meet of \eqn{l} and the line at infinity.
}
\usage{
join(p,q)
meet(l, m)
parallel(p,l)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{p, q}{
    \eqn{(3 \times 1)} vectors of the homogeneous coordinates of a point.
  }
  \item{l, m}{
    \eqn{(3 \times 1)} vectors of the homogeneous representation of a line.
  }
}
%\details{

\value{
  A \eqn{(3 \times 1)} vector of either the homogeneous coordinates of the meet of two lines (a point), the homogeneous representation of the join of two points (line), or the homogeneous representation of the parallel line. The vector has the form \eqn{(x,y,1)}.
